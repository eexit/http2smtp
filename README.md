An API that forwards HTTP-backed vendor mailer calls to SMTP.

Plug a [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) or [MailCatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/) to API email sending vendors such as [SparkPost](https://www.sparkpost.com/), [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) or [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) for testing purposes.

## Usage

See [examples](examples).

:zap: ProTip: for tracing purposes, this app kinda supports [W3C Trace Context recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/). Configure the env var `TRACEPARENT_HEADER` and inject any trace into this header value. All log entries will be contextualized with the given value.

### Docker image

1. Checkout this repo or only copy the `.env.dist` and `docker-compose.yml` files
1. Rename `.env.dist` into `.env`
1. Optional: update the values accordingly
1. Pull images and run `docker-compose up http2smtp`
